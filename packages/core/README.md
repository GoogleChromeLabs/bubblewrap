# Bubblewrap Core
![Node CI Status](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)

Bubblewrap Core is a NodeJS library that helps developers to create a Project for an Android
application that launches an existing Progressive Web App (PWA) using a
[Trusted Web Activity (TWA)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/).

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.0 or above

## Setting up the Environment

### Get the Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.
The Android Command line tools requires the correct version of the JDK to run. To prevent version
conflicts with a JDK version that is already installed, Bubblewrap uses a JDK that can unzipped in
a separate folder.

Download a version of JDK 8 that is compatible with your OS from
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)
and extract it in its own folder.

**Warning:** Using a version lower than 8 will make it impossible to compile the project and higher
versions are incompatible with the Android command line tools.

### Get the Android command line tools
Download a version of Android command line tools that is compatible with your OS from
[https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools).
Create a folder and extract the downloaded file into it.

## Using @bubblewrap/core in a NodeJs project

```shell
npm i -g @bubblewrap/core
```
